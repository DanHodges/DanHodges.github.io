## About Me
My name is Dan Hodges. This is where I post.
## Intentions
#### From most to least realistic
- Clarify my own thoughts by externally processing.
- Memorialize the process of learning.
- Post social media esq things for family and friends.
- Engage with the developer community, in Nashville and beyond.
